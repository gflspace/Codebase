        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 3: GETTING STARTED -->
    <div class="section page-break">
        <h2>3. Getting Started</h2>

        <p class="question">How do I sign up?</p>
        <p>Getting started with QwickServices is straightforward. Download the User App from either the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, then follow the on-screen instructions to create your account. You will need to provide some basic information and complete a verification step to ensure the safety of all platform users.</p>

        <p class="question">What do I need to create an account?</p>
        <p>The signup process is designed to be simple while maintaining security for everyone on the platform. During registration, you will create your profile and verify your identity. Once complete, you can begin posting jobs or browsing services immediately.</p>

        <div class="step-box">
            <strong>Quick Start Steps:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Download the QwickServices User App</li>
                <li>Open the app and select "Sign Up"</li>
                <li>Complete the registration form</li>
                <li>Verify your account</li>
                <li>Start exploring services</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p class="question">Having trouble logging in?</p>
        <p>If you are experiencing difficulties accessing your account, first ensure you are using the correct app. QwickServices has separate apps for customers and providers. Customers should use the User App. If you continue to have issues, the app includes options to reset your password or contact support.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 4: FINDING AND BOOKING -->
    <div class="section page-break">
        <h2>4. Finding and Booking Services</h2>

        <p class="question">How do I post a job?</p>
        <p>When you know what you need but want providers to come to you, posting a job is the way to go. You can create a job listing that includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A clear title describing the service you need</li>
            <li>A detailed description of the work</li>
            <li>Your budget for the job</li>
            <li>Your preferred deadline or timeframe</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once your job is posted, interested providers can view it and express their interest. You then choose the provider who best fits your needs.</p>

        <p class="question">Can I change my job posting after I create it?</p>
        <p>Yes, you can edit your job details at any time before a provider is hired. This gives you flexibility if your requirements change or you need to add more information. Once a provider has been hired, the job details are locked to ensure clarity for both parties.</p>

        <p class="question">How do I find and hire a provider directly?</p>
        <p>If you prefer to browse and select a provider yourself, you can explore the available services and provider profiles. Each provider's profile includes information about their skills, experience, and ratings from previous customers. When you find someone who matches your needs, you can hire them directly through the app.</p>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Helpful Tip:</strong><br>
            Take time to review provider profiles and ratings before making your choice. This helps ensure you find the right match for your specific needs.
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 5: PAYMENTS -->
    <div class="section page-break">
        <h2>5. Payments, Points, and Rewards</h2>

        <p class="question">How does payment work on QwickServices?</p>
        <p>QwickServices uses a secure escrow system to protect both customers and providers. When you book a service, your payment is held safely by the platform. The provider only receives payment once the job is complete and you are satisfied with the work. This arrangement gives you peace of mind and ensures providers are motivated to deliver quality service.</p>

        <p class="question">What is the Points System?</p>
        <p>QwickServices uses an internal Points System as a flexible way to pay for services. Points work like a digital wallet within the platform, making transactions smooth and straightforward.</p>

        <p class="question">How do I get Points?</p>
        <p>There are several ways to build up your Points balance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purchase Points</strong> using Mobile Money (MTN or Orange) or card payments</li>
            <li><strong>Earn Points</strong> through referrals when you invite friends to join QwickServices</li>
            <li><strong>Promotions</strong> that occasionally offer bonus Points</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="important-box">
            <strong>Important:</strong><br>
            Points expire 12 months after they are added to your account. Be sure to use them before they expire to get the full benefit.
        </div>

        <p class="question">When do Points appear in my account?</p>
        <p>Points that you purchase appear in your account once the payment is processed. Points earned through referrals or job-related activities appear after the relevant job is completed.</p>

        <p class="question">What about refunds?</p>
        <p>Refunds are handled based on the outcome of any dispute. If a situation arises where you believe a refund is warranted, you can file a dispute through the platform. The resolution of your dispute will determine whether and how a refund is processed.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 6: MANAGING BOOKINGS -->
    <div class="section page-break">
        <h2>6. Managing Your Bookings</h2>

        <p class="question">How do I track my jobs?</p>
        <p>All your active and past bookings are organized in the "My Bookings" section of the app. Here you can see the status of each job, communicate with your provider, and take actions like confirming completion or raising concerns.</p>

        <p class="question">Can I cancel a booking?</p>
        <p>You can cancel a job before a provider has accepted it without any complications. Once a provider has been assigned and has accepted the job, cancellation becomes more complex. In these cases, you may need to work through the dispute process to resolve any outstanding matters fairly.</p>

        <p class="question">How do I communicate with my provider?</p>
        <p>All communication between customers and providers happens through the in-app messaging system. This keeps your conversations organized and creates a record that can be helpful if any questions arise later.</p>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Helpful Tip:</strong><br>
            Use the in-app messaging for all discussions about your job. This ensures everything is documented and makes it easier to resolve any misunderstandings.
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 7: FOR PROVIDERS -->
    <div class="section page-break">
        <h2>7. For Service Providers</h2>

        <p class="question">How do I become a provider on QwickServices?</p>
        <p>If you have skills and services to offer, QwickServices welcomes you to join as a provider. You will need to download the Provider App and complete an onboarding process that includes verification steps. This ensures that all providers on the platform meet quality and trust standards.</p>

        <p class="question">How do providers receive jobs?</p>
        <p>Providers receive job opportunities based on their availability settings and the service categories they have registered for. When a matching job is posted or a customer searches for services you offer, you may receive a notification or appear in search results.</p>

        <p class="question">How do providers earn money?</p>
        <p>Providers earn Points through the same Points System used by customers. After completing a job, Points are credited to the provider's account. These Points can then be converted to CFA currency and cashed out.</p>

        <p class="question">Are there fees for cashing out?</p>
        <p>Cash-out requests may incur a small fee, typically ranging from 0.5% to 2% depending on the amount and method. Larger cash-out amounts may require additional verification or admin approval, which can add some processing time.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
            <strong>For Providers:</strong><br>
            Maintain good ratings and keep your availability up to date to maximize your job opportunities. Respond promptly to inquiries and deliver quality work to build a strong reputation on the platform.
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 8: SAFETY -->
    <div class="section page-break">
        <h2>8. Safety and Trust</h2>

        <p class="question">How does QwickServices keep me safe?</p>
        <p>Your safety is a priority. QwickServices has built several protections into the platform to help keep all transactions secure and all users safe.</p>

        <p class="question">What should I do to stay safe?</p>
        <p>Here are the key practices we recommend:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Keep all communication in the app.</strong> Using the in-app messaging system creates a record and keeps your personal contact details private.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not share personal contact information</strong> such as your phone number, email, or home address outside of what is necessary for the service.</li>
            <li><strong>Release payment only when satisfied.</strong> The escrow system means your payment is held until the job is complete. Only confirm completion when you are genuinely happy with the work.</li>

        <h2>9. Reviews and Ratings</h2>

        <p class="question">How do reviews work?</p>
        <p>After a job is completed, you have the opportunity to leave a rating and review for your provider. This feedback helps other customers make informed decisions and helps providers build their reputation on the platform.</p>

        <p class="question">Why are reviews important?</p>
        <p>Reviews create trust within the QwickServices community. When you share your honest experience, you help:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Other customers find reliable providers</li>
            <li>Quality providers get recognized for their good work</li>
            <li>The platform maintain high service standards</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="question">Can I see reviews before booking?</p>
        <p>Yes. Provider profiles include ratings and reviews from previous customers. We encourage you to read these before making your hiring decision to ensure a good match.</p>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Helpful Tip:</strong><br>
            Leave detailed, honest reviews after each job. Mention what went well and any areas for improvement. This helps the entire QwickServices community.

        <h2>10. Resolving Issues and Disputes</h2>

        <p class="question">What if something goes wrong?</p>
        <p>While we hope every job goes smoothly, we understand that issues can sometimes arise. QwickServices has a fair dispute resolution process to help address problems.</p>

        <p class="question">How do I file a dispute?</p>
        <p>If you have a concern that you cannot resolve directly with your provider, you can file a dispute from your dashboard within the app. When filing, provide as much detail as possible about the issue and include any relevant evidence such as photos or message screenshots.</p>

        <p class="question">How are disputes handled?</p>
        <p>Once a dispute is filed, the QwickServices admin team reviews it carefully. Both parties have the opportunity to share their side of the story and submit evidence. Decisions are made fairly based on the information provided, with the goal of reaching a reasonable resolution for everyone involved.</p>

        <p class="question">Can providers respond to disputes?</p>
        <p>Yes. Providers can submit their perspective and evidence when a dispute is raised. The admin team considers input from both the customer and the provider before making a decision.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
            <strong>Fair Process:</strong><br>
            Dispute decisions are evidence-based. The more clearly you can document your concern, the more effectively we can help resolve it.
