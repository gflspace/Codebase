# Risk Detection & Enforcement Input Framework

**System:** QwickServices Contact Integrity System (CIS)  
**Model Role:** Risk Detection & Enforcement Input Model  
**Objective:** Define lawful, minimal, and effective data inputs to support accurate detection, pattern analysis, and proportional enforcement

---

## 1. Enumerated Data Sources

### 1. Message Content (Consent-Bound)

**Description**  
In-platform messages and attachments exchanged between users within QwickServices.

**Purpose / Use Cases**
- Detect explicit policy violations (off-platform contact sharing, solicitation)
- Identify intent escalation (accidental → deliberate)
- Detect obfuscation, coded language, or evasion attempts

**Consent & Legal Constraints**
- Access only with user consent or other lawful basis
- Limited strictly to enforcement-related contexts
- Exclude content unrelated to suspected violations
- Sensitive personal data must be redacted where feasible

**Retention & Access Guidelines**
- Short-lived retention for raw content
- Long-term storage limited to redacted evidence snapshots
- Access restricted to Trust & Safety only

**Risk of Misuse & Mitigations**
- *Risk:* Overreach or content surveillance  
- *Mitigation:* Event-triggered access, keyword-agnostic pattern analysis, access logging

---

### 2. Metadata (Non-Content Signals)

**Description**  
Non-content interaction signals generated by platform usage.

**Included Signals**
- Message timestamps
- Sender/receiver identifiers
- Conversation or thread IDs
- Device type and platform (web/mobile/OS)
- Session identifiers
- IP-derived coarse region (country / city-level max)

**Purpose / Use Cases**
- Frequency and burst analysis
- Behavioral pattern detection
- Cross-session and cross-account correlation

**Consent & Legal Constraints**
- Must not be used for user surveillance
- Precise geolocation prohibited unless legally mandated
- IP data must be coarse and transient

**Retention & Access Guidelines**
- Retained longer than content but time-bounded
- Accessible to Trust & Safety and limited Ops analytics

**Risk of Misuse & Mitigations**
- *Risk:* Behavioral profiling beyond intent  
- *Mitigation:* Aggregation, anonymization, and strict purpose limitation

---

### 3. Transaction Attempts & Failures

**Description**  
Signals generated from payment-related activity within QwickServices.

**Included Signals**
- Payment initiation timestamps
- Success, failure, cancellation, or timeout states
- Platform-supported payment method type (e.g., Mobile Money, Card)

**Purpose / Use Cases**
- Correlate enforcement events with transaction timing
- Detect fee-avoidance or redirection attempts
- Identify post-payment abuse or cancellation fraud

**Consent & Legal Constraints**
- No storage of full payment credentials
- All identifiers tokenized or hashed
- Must comply with PCI-DSS and local financial regulations

**Retention & Access Guidelines**
- Retention aligned with financial audit requirements
- Access limited to Trust & Safety and Finance-compliance roles

**Risk of Misuse & Mitigations**
- *Risk:* Financial over-collection  
- *Mitigation:* Minimal event logging, no balance or credential access

---

### 4. User Profiles & Historical Flags

**Description**  
Longitudinal account-level attributes used for contextual risk assessment.

**Included Signals**
- Account age and tenure
- Verification status
- Trust or reputation scores
- Prior warnings, restrictions, suspensions
- Appeal history and outcomes

**Purpose / Use Cases**
- Risk scoring and escalation logic
- Repeat-offense detection
- Proportional enforcement decisions

**Consent & Legal Constraints**
- Flags must be explainable and reviewable
- No permanent stigma or hidden blacklists
- Users retain right to access and correction

**Retention & Access Guidelines**
- Retained only while relevant to risk modeling
- Periodic decay or expiration of low-severity flags

**Risk of Misuse & Mitigations**
- *Risk:* Bias amplification or over-escalation  
- *Mitigation:* Time decay, appeal integration, reviewer oversight

---

## 2. Data Integration Rules

- Combine multiple data sources before enforcement decisions
- No enforcement based on a single signal alone
- Prefer aggregated scores over raw data exposure
- Explicitly document which signals contributed to a decision
- Log all data access for auditability

---

## 3. Privacy & Compliance Guardrails

### Core Principles
- Data minimization by default
- Purpose limitation strictly enforced
- Consent-aware processing

### Access Controls
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Separation between Ops analytics and enforcement evidence
- Immutable access logs

### Transparency
- User-visible explanations when enforcement occurs
- Disclosure of automated decision support where required

---

## 4. Risk Areas & Mitigations (Summary)

| Risk Area | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| Content over-collection | Event-triggered access, redaction |
| Metadata misuse | Aggregation, coarse location only |
| Financial data exposure | Tokenization, PCI controls |
| Bias from history | Time decay, appeal feedback loops |

---

## 5. Audit & Compliance Checklist

- [ ] Lawful basis documented for each data source
- [ ] Consent requirements enforced
- [ ] Retention periods defined and implemented
- [ ] RBAC policies active and tested
- [ ] Access logs immutable and reviewable
- [ ] User transparency requirements met
