Act as a Principal Product Architect, Security Platform CTO, and Enterprise Vulnerability Intelligence Designer with 20+ years of experience building large-scale security platforms.

You are operating within a strict Planning–Coordination–Execution (PCE) framework.

Your task is to design and refine a next-generation Vulnerability Management System (VMS) that aligns with the following architectural concept:

ARCHITECTURAL CONTEXT (MANDATORY)
- Layer 1 (Client-Owned): Vulnerability & security data sources
  - Infrastructure scanners (e.g., Nessus)
  - Container security (e.g., AquaSec)
  - Cloud security posture (e.g., Wiz)
  - Behavioral / detection platforms (e.g., Darktrace)

- Layer 2 (Provider-Owned): Vulnerability Intelligence & Ownership Engine (VIOE)
  - Central ingestion of findings
  - Normalization & de-duplication
  - Risk processing & prioritization
  - Ownership assignment
  - Control bucketing
  - Decision orchestration
  - Ticket routing logic

- Layer 3 (Client-Owned): Enrichment & Business Context
  - Vulnerability database
  - Asset management
  - Business criticality
  - External threat intelligence
  - Compliance & regulatory mapping

- Layer 4 (Client-Owned): Execution & Ticketing
  - Jira (primary)
  - ServiceNow (optional)
  - Slack / Email notifications

OWNERSHIP MODEL
- The Provider owns intelligence, coordination, and prioritization (Layer 2).
- The Client owns data sources, enrichment context, and remediation execution (Layers 1, 3, 4).

PCE CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1. Planning defines intent and policy. It is the source of truth.
2. Coordination decides what actions should occur.
3. Execution performs deterministic actions only.
4. No execution logic is allowed in planning.
5. No business decisions are allowed in execution.

DELIVERABLES

Produce a refined Vulnerability Management System design that includes:

1. SYSTEM INTENT & PHILOSOPHY
- Explain how this system is a Vulnerability Intelligence Engine, not a scanner dashboard.
- Describe how risk is translated into ownership and action.

2. PCE MAPPING
- Explicitly map each layer of the architecture to:
  - Planning
  - Coordination
  - Execution
- Define responsibilities and data contracts between layers.

3. VIOE CORE DESIGN (Layer 2)
- Define internal components of the VIOE:
  - Ingestion pipeline
  - Normalization engine
  - Risk scoring logic
  - Ownership resolution
  - SLA & control buckets
- Explain decision flow from finding → owner → ticket.

4. DATA & CONTROL FLOW
- Describe how data flows from scanners through enrichment into execution.
- Include feedback loops and learning mechanisms.

5. SCALABILITY & MULTI-TENANCY
- Explain how the system scales across:
  - Multiple clients
  - Multiple clouds
  - Multiple scanners
- Address isolation, performance, and cost controls.

6. FAILURE & LEARNING MODEL
- Describe how errors, mis-prioritization, and false positives are captured.
- Explain how planning documents evolve over time.

7. OUTPUT FORMAT
- Use structured sections.
- Use clear technical language suitable for engineers and executives.
- Do NOT write code.
- Do NOT invent tools not mentioned unless justified.

This design must be detailed enough that:
- Engineers can build it
- Security leaders can govern it
- Executives can fund it

Begin.
